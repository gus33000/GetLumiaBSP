# GetLumiaBSP

GetLumiaBSP (GLB) is an utility designed to facilitate the port of other NT based operating systems to newer Lumia phone models.
The utility allows to separate the board support package (BSP) from the operating system image, and applies fixes through "care" features configurable invidually.

# Todo list

  - Better implementation for DirectX care
  - Auto detect problematic drivers when needed
  - Auto disable problematic drivers on Spec A devices
  - Inf generation from packages
  - UnBSP (Remove a BSP from an imaage instead of porting it)
  - Work on Hybrid BSPs, crossover from ENOSW (MMOS) and MainOS
  - Better documentation
  - ARM64 support fixes (Currently the tool gets Microsoft owned packages for whatever reason)
  - Move to owned code for dealing with compressed streams

### Building

Install Microsoft Visual Studio with the .NET desktop application workload, and compile the tool in neutral.
__Note: third party utilities are used for now to deal with compressed streams.__
